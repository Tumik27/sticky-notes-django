I manually tested the sticky notes application in the browser.
I created a new note using the “Add new note” link and confirmed it saved correctly.
I opened a note to view its details and confirmed the correct title and content display.
I edited an existing note and confirmed the changes were saved and shown on the list page.
I deleted a note and confirmed it was removed from the list.
